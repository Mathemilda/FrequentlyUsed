Here you can find:

  1. Simple function for a date (maybe with time) as a string
  2. A method to estimate execution time for a code with iterations.
  3. A fuction to write a bunch of Pandas DataFrames as Excel Workbook with a named worksheet for each.

   1. To add uniformly distributed noise to data.
   2. To add a tilt to an image (like more general shear).
